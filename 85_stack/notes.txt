HW85 -- Leon Leonwood Stack
2022-03-30
time spent: 0.3 hr

DISCO:
* LinkedLists appears to be better suited to stacks than ArrayLists, since they come with addLast, getLast, and removeLast methods.
ArrayLists lack this nice behavior
QCC:
* Are there any major differences in runtime between a stack that uses ArrayLists as opposed to LinkedLists?
* Do actual stacks tend to use ArrayLists, LinkedLists, or arrays?

It doesn't matter what you call the parameter for a generic type, but T is very useful and readable.

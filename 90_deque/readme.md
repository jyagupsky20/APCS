# Team Something Important
## Joshua Yagupsky, Jaylen Zeng, Jonathan Song

#### Methods we are going to implement (in order of importance):
* addFirst, addLast
* removeFirst, removeLast
* getFirst, getLast
* isEmpty
* size
* iterator

#### Plan

Using LinkedLists as our collection, we plan to use the built-in LinkedList methods to make adding and removing elements on both ends much easier. We realized that the functionality of many LinkedList methods are similar to that of the Deque methods we plan to implement. In fact, they even share the same name (addFirst, removeLast, etc).

HW82 -- Roll Your Own Iterator
2022-03-26
time spent: 0.5 hr

We first made a private, non-static class inside the LList class that contained the features we would want from an iterator that works with a doubly linked list.
This class implemented the Iterator<T> interface. We wanted it private so that users of LList couldn't accidentally access it, and we wanted it non static
so that it worked with each instance of LList, and not the class as a whole. We then made a public iterator() which returned a new instance of this class.

DISCO:
* You can have classes inside other classes, which can see the private members of the outside class.

QCC:
* Can static nested classes access static members of the outer class?
* What exactly does package-private do?

DISCO
\t is the tab character in regex
.jar files can contain class files
The -classpath flag tells java where it can look for class files when compiling
TSV, or tab separated value files, are usually easier to deal with than CSV, or comma separated value files.
QCC

Activity 1 Questions:
1. Youtube, Twitter, Facebook
2. Your name, personal preferences based on media viewed,
3. Delimited means "separated," referring to how a data file needs to separate different types of data for each object into different categories.
4. You can look through the whole column and see what the objects in that column have in common.
5. Competitive Rubik's cube solving, video game console history
6. What Rubik's cube competition has had the most competitors?
7. For Rubik's cube competitions, the World Cube Association has a database of competitions, which can be found at https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/misc/export.html
8. There are 7806 records, which is beneficial because it means our data is less prone to bias and error.
9. By knowing your watch history, Youtube can recommend you more videos you will find interesting.
10. All Rubik's cube competitions are already posted on the WCA website.
11. So long as Youtube keeps its data on our watch histories private, the entertainment benefit is likely worth the risk.
Activity 2 Questions:

1. Cereal
3. public class Cereal
4. 15 instance variables
5. String name, String type, int calories, int protein, int fat, int sodium, double fiber, double carbs, int sugar, int potassium, int vitamins, int shelf, double weight, double cups, double rating.
8. Which of the listed cereals has the highest carbohydrate content?
9. Which of the listed cereals has the highest rating?
10. We could add a rating attribute with an acessor method to our class.

Activity 3 Questions:
1. The temperatur at Atlanta, Hartsfield - Jackson Atlanta International Airport, GA is 66.0F
2. PHTO: The temperature at Hilo, Hilo International Airport, HI is 77.0F
4. 2877
5. We could use latitude or longitude.
6. NSTU: Pago Pago, AS, Samoa
7. What is the westernmost weather station?
8. We would write a getLon() method to return the longitude, and then traverse through the ArrayList to find the westernmost station.
9. We would need one accessor method and would need to slightly modify our loop for the southernMost station.

Activity 4 Questions:
1. We wanted to know which Rubik's cube competition was the farthest south. We chose this question because it was relatively easy to implement, but the manner in which
we programmed it allowed for other sorts of questions to be answered, such as the southern most competition in a particular year.
2. We used the World Cube Association's competition dataset, which we found on the Database page of their website.
3. We first created a class that would serve as a record for an individual competition, introducing the fields we thought were the most important. We then processed the file into an ArrayList of these records, and traversed through the ArrayList to find the southern most competition.
We found out that Southern Scramble Dunedin 2021 in New Zealand took place in 2021 with events 222 333 333bf 333oh 444 555 666 777 clock minx pyram skewb sq1 at location -45907982 170498888.
4. Our Competition class contained data on the competition name, country, year, events, latitude, and longitude, as these were the easiest to read from the TSV file.
5. Here was our code segment:
public static void main(String[] args) {
  ArrayList<Competition> clist = new ArrayList<Competition>();
  List<String> currentLine = new ArrayList<String>();
  Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in); //Uses redirection
  scanner.nextLine(); //Ignores the initial line
  while (scanner.hasNextLine()){
    currentLine = Arrays.asList(scanner.nextLine().toString().split("\t"));
    clist.add(new Competition(currentLine.get(1),currentLine.get(3),Integer.parseInt(currentLine.get(5)),currentLine.get(11), Integer.parseInt(currentLine.get(19)),Integer.parseInt(currentLine.get(20))));
  }
  Competition southernMost = clist.get(0);
  for (Competition c: clist ) {
    if(c.latitude() < southernMost.latitude()){
      southernMost = c;
    }
  }
  System.out.println(southernMost);
}

We have a scanner that reads from System.in, which we redirect at runtime to read from the tsv. We then skip the first line, since it contains unnecessary info.
For each line, we split on the tab character and add the data to our list of records. We then loop through the list, continually updating the southern most competition.

<Team Trio of Two>'s CSV FLOW:
Our data on Rubik's cube competitions came as a TSV.
We used a scanner to split each line into its own record. We then split on the tab character \t and picked out the fields of each record we wanted.

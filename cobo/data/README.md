Team Something Important Minus One :: Joshua Yagupsky, Jonathan Song

Overall, this lab was very interesting, as well as being simple enough to easily do all of the activities. We also learned how to run the class path command, and how to extract data. This lab has been very helpful overall. However, there was a data loss towards the end, where our Cereal file was reverted to a previous version

ACTIVITY 2 QUESTIONS:
1. A deck encapsulates an ArrayList of Cards. It doesn't allow you to directly interface with the underlying ArrayList, but it does give limited access through methods like deal().
2. This deck contains six cards, since there are 3 ranks and 2 suits.
3. ranks = {"Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine", "Ten", "Jack", "Queen", "King", "Ace"};
suits = {"Hearts", "Clubs", "Diamonds", "Spades"};
pointValues = {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14};
4. The ordering of the suits array does not matter at all. However, the ranks and pointValues arrays must have the same relative ordering: the card at index i of ranks must have the point value of index i in pointValues.
You can rearrange both lists, but you must rearrange them in the same manner.

Note for Activity 3: There is a technique in cards called a "Faro Shuffle" which, when executed correctly, will perfectly shuffle the cards. It is somewhat difficult to learn, however.
Here is a tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-tSm8g-_pw
ACTIVITY 3 QUESTIONS:
1.
public static String flip(){
  int k = (int) (Math.random() * 2)
  if(k == 0){
    return "heads";
  }
  else{
    return "tails";
  }
}

2.
public static boolean arePermutations(int[] arr1, int[] arr2){
  int matches = 0;
  for(int a1 : arr1){
    for(int a2: arr2){
      if(a1 == a2){
        matches++;
      }
    }
  }
  return (matches == arr1.length);
}

3.
0,1,1,0

ACTIVITY 5 QUESTIONS:
Note: Buggy1 through Buggy4 had no deck file for us to test
Buggy5:
isEmpty: We replaced less than with less than or equal to
shuffle: k should be greater than or equal to 0, not less than 0
deal: size-- moved to after the if statement

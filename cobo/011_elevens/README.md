###Team Something Important Minus One: Joshua Yagupsky, Jonathan Song###

Overall, the lab was fairly enjoyable. The most useful thing we learned from this lab was how abstract classes work, and how they are different from interfaces.
However, we did run into some issues. Most of the code for Activity 5 was missing. In addition, the lab took far longer than we had originally anticipated.

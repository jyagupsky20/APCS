# Team Something Important Minus One: Joshua Yagupsky, Jonathan Song
APCS pd7
L07 --  Card Game
2022-03-20
time spent: 3.5 hr

Overall, the lab was fairly enjoyable. The most useful thing we learned from this lab was how abstract classes work, and how they are different from interfaces. Assert statements and the override flag are also very useful when it comes to debugging your code.
However, we did run into some issues. Most of the code for Activity 5 was originally missing, although this was resolved. The 11th activity mentioned a boolean instance variable that was not present (although it did not seem to affect anything important). In addition, the lab took far longer than we had originally anticipated.

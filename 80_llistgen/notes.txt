HW80 -- Generically Speaking
2022-03-23
time spent: 0.2 hr

TIPS:
Be sure everything generic has the same type. In our LList file, we replaced every instance of DLLNode with
DLLNode<T>
DISCO:

QCC:
* Besides using wrapper classes, is there any way to use a primitive type as an argument for a generic?
* Can you have methods that use generic parameters without the class using a generic parameter?
